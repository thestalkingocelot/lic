**Lic** is a cross-platform, Python, OpenGL & Qt powered desktop application for creating and editing LEGO instruction books. **Lic** imports 3D models, organizes them into submodels, pages & steps, and exports the end result as images or PDF.

Highlights:

  * A rich, WYSIWYG UI editor, which provides a fully interactive preview window along side a drag & drop-enabled navigation tree, to help organize and layout your book.

  * Automatically divide your model into steps. Add a list of parts needed for each step, and auto-layout multiple steps per page for a best fit. Auto-generate a title page and part list pages.

So far, **Lic** can import any LDraw model, but its dynamic importer makes it easy to add an importer for any 3D file type, and create instructions for that model. A Lego Digital Designer (LDD) importer is coming soon.

When you're done, **Lic** can export a final instruction book as a series of images or as a high resolution PDF.

**Lic** is currently in a late alpha stage, and is improving very quickly.  Check out the [Lic home page](http://bugeyedmonkeys.com/lic_info/) for screen shots and more info.

There's Windows and OSX binary packages available for download; this version has been tested against a handful of machines & video cards, and works well, but does require newer hardware.  Let me know if you have any problems - I'm interested in trying to support older hardware, but have nothing to test against.
